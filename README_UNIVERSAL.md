# Universal AI Agent System

## 🌟 Overview

The Universal AI Agent System represents the ultimate evolution in AI agent architecture, designed with **infinite flexibility**, **unlimited scalability**, and **maximum intelligence**. This system minimizes hardcoding to near-zero levels while maximizing adaptability through universal patterns and prompt-driven design.

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

- **Universal Patterns**: Everything is built on universal, reusable patterns
- **Infinite Adaptability**: System adapts to any task, domain, or requirement
- **Continuous Evolution**: Self-improving and self-optimizing architecture
- **Persistent Intelligence**: Each agent maintains independent, continuous execution

### 2. Universal Entity Model

Everything in the system is represented as a `UniversalEntity`:

```python
@dataclass
class UniversalEntity:
    id: str
    type: UniversalType  # AGENT, TASK, MESSAGE, MEMORY, PLUGIN, etc.
    name: str
    description: str
    content: Any
    metadata: Dict[str, Any]
    capabilities: Set[str]
    relationships: Dict[str, Set[str]]
