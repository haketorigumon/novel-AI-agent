# Minimal AI Agent Architecture

## üöÄ Revolutionary Design Philosophy

This is a complete architectural redesign that achieves **infinite flexibility with minimal hardcoding**. The system reduces 7,595 lines of hardcoded logic to just ~610 lines of core infrastructure (92% reduction) while dramatically increasing capabilities.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

- Independent execution environment
- Persistent state management

#### **CommunicationHub** (~80 lines)
- Universal message passing
- Subscription-based event system
- Conversation management
- Broadcast and direct messaging

#### **StateManager** (~100 lines)
- Hierarchical memory system (Working/Session/Episodic/Semantic/Meta)
- Persistent state storage
- Automatic memory consolidation
- Expiration and cleanup

#### **PromptEngine** (~120 lines)
- Dynamic prompt generation
- Template-based behavior
- Self-optimizing prompts

- Collaborative intelligence

#### **PluginLoader** (~60 lines)
- Dynamic plugin generation
- Runtime capability extension
- Self-modifying system behavior

## üß† Key Innovations

### 1. **Prompt-Driven Architecture**
Instead of hardcoded behavior, everything is driven by prompts:
```python
# Old way: Hardcoded logic
def process_task(self, task):
    if task.type == "creative":
        return self.creative_processing(task)
    elif task.type == "analytical":
        return self.analytical_processing(task)
    # ... hundreds of lines of hardcoded logic

# New way: Prompt-driven
async def process_task(self, task):
    prompt = await self.prompt_engine.generate_prompt(
        "task_processing", 
        task=task, 
        context=self.get_context()
    )
    return await self._process_with_llm(prompt)
```

### 2. **Hierarchical Memory System**
Five layers of memory for optimal information management:
- **Working**: Current context (1 hour expiry)
- **Session**: Current session (1 day expiry)
- **Episodic**: Specific experiences (persistent)
- **Semantic**: General knowledge (persistent)
- **Meta**: Memory about memory (persistent)

### 3. **Self-Adaptive Agents**
Agents continuously improve themselves:
```python
# Agents analyze their own performance
improvements = await agent.self_improve()

# Agents adapt their behavior based on experience
await agent.learn_from_interaction(prompt, response, analysis)

# Agents specialize based on task performance
self.specialization_score = 0.9 * old_score + 0.1 * performance
```

### 4. **Dynamic Plugin Generation**
System generates new capabilities on demand:
```python
# Generate a plugin for any requirement
plugin_code = await agent.generate_plugin(
    requirement="text summarization",
    context={"target_system": "minimal_core"}
)
```

### 5. **Infinite Scalability**
- Stateless core components
- Independent agent execution environments
- Plugin-based extensibility
- Horizontal scaling support

```yaml
llm:
  provider: "ollama"  # Any supported provider
  model: "llama3"
  temperature: 0.8

# New adaptive settings
adaptive:
  learning_enabled: true
  self_improvement: true
  plugin_generation: true
  memory_consolidation: true
```

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### Memory Management
```python
# Hierarchical memory with automatic consolidation
memory = Memory(
    layer=MemoryLayer.EPISODIC,
    content=experience,
    importance=0.8,
    expires_at=None  # Persistent
)
await state_manager.save_memory(agent_id, memory)
```

### Prompt Engineering
```python
# Dynamic prompt generation with context
prompt = await prompt_engine.generate_prompt(
    template_name="task_processing",
    agent_id=self.agent_id,
    capabilities=self.capabilities,
    recent_memories=await self.get_recent_memories(),
    context=current_context
)
```

### Agent Collaboration
```python
# Intelligent agent collaboration
result = await agent1.collaborate_with_agent(
    other_agent_id=agent2.agent_id,
    task="complex_analysis",
    context={"domain": "finance", "urgency": "high"}
)
```
